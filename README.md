# P3 - Build A Survey Form
Top education programs always seek for students' feedback, and that's why we are going to build A `Survey Form`!

## Getting Started
- Download this branch
- Create a simple `Project Structure` with the following: `index.html`, `style.css`, `css/`
- The `Structure Tree` should look like this:
```
-- index.html
-- css/
---- css/style.css
```
- Build your own `Survey Form` with `HTML/CSS` & match it with the `Final Result`

## Deliverables Instructions
- Open the [Workshop's Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1NSbd29QsturGGTne4UyBh1VOT3rkduOm)
- Create a folder with your name (i.e. `Yahya Elharony`)
- Inside it, upload the project folder - `P3-Survey-Form` and follow it with `--your-name`. Example: `"P3-Survey-Form--Yahya-Elharony"`
> Naming your Project's Folder with your name will make it easier for the `Project Reviewers` to download/review your code
