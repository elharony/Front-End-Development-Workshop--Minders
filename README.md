# P4 - Build A Survey Form
Top education programs always seek for students' feedback, and that's why we are going to build A `Survey Form` to get some feedbacks!

## Helpers
- There are 2 important tags in HTML; `label`, `input`. In our project; The `Name` is the **label** and `Enter your name` input field is the `input` tag
- `input` tag has many types. Here are some examples:
```
<input type="text"> <!-- Normal text like `Name` -->
<input type="email"> <!-- For the `Email` input -->
```
- Search for `Radiobuttons in HTML`, `Checkboxes in HTML`, `Dropdown in HTML`, `textarea tag`
- There's an HTML Attribute for `input` tags called: `Placeholder`. Search for it!
- The used font is `Raleway`

> This section is written to help you **SEARCH** for new things, **DON'T copy/paste code without understanding it** as you might be asked to explain `How you did X`?

## Getting Started
- Create a simple `Project Structure` with the following: `index.html`, `style.css`, `css/`
- The `Structure Tree` should look like this:
```
-- index.html
-- css/
---- css/style.css
```
- Build your own `Survey Form` with `HTML/CSS` & match it with the `Final Result`

## BONUS
**After completing the current requirements, and make a clone of the `Survey Form`** you can add your own creativity & touches to make it better!

## Deliverables Instructions
- Open the [Workshop's Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1NSbd29QsturGGTne4UyBh1VOT3rkduOm)
- Create a folder with your name (i.e. `Yahya Elharony`)
- Inside it, upload the project folder - `P4-Survey-Form` and follow it with `--your-name`. Example: `"P4-Survey-Form--Yahya-Elharony"`
> Naming your Project's Folder with your name will make it easier for the `Project Reviewers` to download/review your code
