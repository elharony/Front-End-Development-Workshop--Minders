# P4 - Product Landing Page
Do you have a startup app idea? Let's build a landing page for your product!

## Requirements & Instructions
- Create a simple `Project Structure` with the following: `index.html`, `style.css`, `css/`, `img`
- The `Structure Tree` should look like this:
```
-- index.html
-- css/
-- img/
---- css/style.css
```
- [Build a clone of this demo](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL) (Copy/Paste the content)

> The `img` folder isn't required unless you have images in your landing page

## Deliverables Instructions
- Open the [Workshop's Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1NSbd29QsturGGTne4UyBh1VOT3rkduOm)
- Create a folder with your name (i.e. `Yahya Elharony`)
- Inside it, upload the project folder - `P4-Product-Landing-Page` and follow it with `--your-name`. Example: `"P4-Product-Landing-Page--Yahya-Elharony"`
> Naming your Project's Folder with your name will make it easier for the `Project Reviewers` to download/review your code

## BONUS TIP!
The demo isn't looking good and you might have many ideas/improvements to do. Feel free to add your own touch, make it more appealing and even add more sections - **HINT:** `Features`, `About Us`
